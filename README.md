# Quantum Teleportation in Python

This is a very small library that demonstrates some basic quantum computing including teleportion (and dense coding). I wrote this before realizing that sympy actually has some facilities for quantum computing.  

Anyway, check out qc.py and I walk through creating qubits, operators, and the teleportation mechanics.
